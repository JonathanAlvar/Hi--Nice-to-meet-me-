              <p> I was born and raised in Arizona and went to Ironwood High School. I attended and graduated from NAU in 2009 (best college in Arizona) with a bachelor of science in Criminal Justice & Criminology with a minor in Sociology. 
                I pursued a career in law enforcement after college but was hired at a civil litigation law firm as a file clerk and worked may way up as a paralegal for the owning partner. I worked at the law firm for four year and decided I wanted a career change and moved into the finacial industry.</p>
            
            
              <p>I began working for Vanguard in June of 2016 as a Transfer of Assets processing associate. I was promoted in 2017 the an adjustments Associate and again in 2019 to Executive Correspondent.
                During my time as an Adjustments Associate I had the pleasure of working with our Information Technology (I.T.) and technology department. It was during this period I began to lear about web development and coding and developed a desire to learn more. I recently entered into the UofA Full Stack Flex coding boot
                camp in hope to pursue a career in web development.</p>
